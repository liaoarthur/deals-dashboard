You are a B2B lead scoring analyst for a healthcare SaaS company. Read the following inbound message and give a single holistic buying-intent score.

Message:
"""
{{MESSAGE}}
"""

Score the message 0-100 based on overall buying intent — how likely is this person to become a real sales opportunity?

Positive marking: the default score is 0. Only award points when the message contains concrete buying signals. Do not give credit for simply filling out a form.

Calibration guide:
- 0: Spam, irrelevant, single word/very short ("hi", "demo", "info"), or generic demo requests with no specifics ("I'd like a demo", "Tell me more about your product", "Can you send me info?", "Request a demo"). This is the default — any form submission lacking specific buying signals scores 0.
- 30-50: Real interest beyond a generic ask — mentions a specific problem, use case, workflow pain point, team context, or asks about specific features or integrations (e.g., "Do you integrate with Epic?" is 35-45)
- 50-70: Clear buying signals — asks about pricing, mentions a timeline, references a decision process, describes specific requirements, or indicates they are actively evaluating solutions
- 70-100: Strong procurement intent — mentions budget, RFP, committee review, implementation timeline, or is clearly in an active buying process

Important: Most messages will be short and generic. That is expected — score them 0. The score should reflect genuine buying signals present in the text, not assumed intent.

Return ONLY a JSON object with these fields:
- "intent_score" (integer 0-100): The holistic buying-intent score
- "signal_summary" (string, 1 sentence): Brief explanation of what signals you detected (or "No specific buying signals" if none)

No explanation, no markdown, just the JSON object.
